Title: Raspberry Pi with Python
Date: 2018-03-11

I've got a project using [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/), and it make me so happy that I can use Python to program in Raspberry Pi. This tiny device is backed by [Raspbian](http://raspbian.org/), a free operating system based on [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) optimized for Raspberry Pi hardware. The latest version is based on Debian Stretch.
