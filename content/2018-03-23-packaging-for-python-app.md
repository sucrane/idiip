Title: Packaging for Python App
Date: 2018-03-23

It is not quite convenient for our customer to setup Python environment on Windows or other platforms to run our Python app. So we need to pack our Python app into stand-alone .exe file. Fortunately, there are quite a few tools to help us. And among these, PyInstaller is my favorite.

[PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/) is a program that freezes (packages) Python programs into stand-alone executables, under Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, Solaris and AIX. Its main advantages over similar tools are that PyInstaller works with Python 2.7 and 3.3â€”3.6, it builds smaller executables thanks to transparent compression, it is fully multi-platform, and use the OS support to load the dynamic libraries, thus ensuring full compatibility.

We can install PyInstaller using `pip`:

```
pip install pyinstaller
```

Then go to your project's directory, and run:

```
pyinstaller your-app.py
```

It will generate the bundle in a subdirectory called `dist`.
