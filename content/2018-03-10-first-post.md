Title: First Post
Date: 2018-03-10

This is my first post and I did it in Python. How exciting!

This website is generated by [Pelican](http://getpelican.com/) and
using theme [Flex](https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/flex).

For code highlighting, I choose `PYGMENTS_STYLE = 'solarized-dark'`,
with a minor change that I add `.highlight { font-size: 0.9em }` to
make code's font size a little smaller.
